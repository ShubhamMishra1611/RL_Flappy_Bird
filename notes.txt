Steps to be followed:
    1.Make the game which is controlled by user.

    2.Now change the game so that agent can control ...like removing keydown 
    event and initiating game class from coding file... main play function works 
    on action and return rewards
    
    3.Now make a agent that take rewards and gameover and state as input 
    and returns action as output after somewhat exposing it to randomness.

    4.Agent is also supposed to remember the stuff and perform two traing 
        a) Short term training
        b) Long term training

    5.Making the model which takes some feature as input and return the action based
    on learning ,forward feeding.


What is rewarding policy?
    If your score inc. then reward is +10
    If you dies then reward is -10
    Otherwise its zero


What does state consists of ?
    1.Birds y-cordinates
    2.Its danger from the close pipe
        danger is computed as a funciton of distance from the pipe and if it jumps condition

What are actions ?
    Only jump value as True or False after checking the value.
    Again the game looks so flithy to me .... lets see if AI will be able to learn it or not ....

I wish there is no bus in the game to be figured out by the AI.
